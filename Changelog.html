<b>1.0 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Initial (short-lived) release
<b>1.0.1 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Corrected the extension's link to its deviation page
<b>1.0.2 (Apr 13, 2010)</b>
- Middle-clicking a link in Deviant Love now works just like middle-clicking a link in a Web page
- A bug was fixed that would cause odd things to happen if you opened the popup, closed it before it was done scanning, and then opened it again
<b>1.0.3 "Super Scanner Is Ready" (Jun 10, 2010)</b>
- Deviant Love can now scan the Browse view and Collections of a Faves page (previously, they were treated identically to the Favourites view)
- The time between you opening a Faves page and heart appearing may be shorter
- Added plugs for <a href="http://deviantheart.deviantart.com/">#deviantHEART</a> and <a href="http://dalinksystem.deviantart.com/">#dALinkSystem</a> :)
<b>1.0.4 "Deviously Deviant Love" (Dec 28, 2010)</b>
- Fixed a bug caused by the <a href="http://hq.deviantart.com/blog/36320305/">Profile Page galleries upgrade</a> (which of course affected Faves pages as well) that caused Deviant Love to misidentify Collections and the Browse view as the Favourites view (of course, the Favourites view was being correctly identified, which I guess has something to do with broken clocks)
- Corrected the heart's tooltip (it said Devious Love :B)
- Restored compatibility with Chrome 4, which had been removed in 1.0.3 (however, 1.1 will remove compatibility with everything earlier than Chrome 7)
