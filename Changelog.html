<b>2.0 "Game Select 2" (Jul 11, 2011)</b>
- Moved the deviation watch icon after feedback from the only user who gave me any, :devKrisada:
- Added a Favourites link to the left of deviation lists after feedback from Krisada
- Behind-the-scenes improvements
<b>2.0 RC 2 "Shine Refined" (Apr 21, 2011)</b>
- Firefox fix: There was a situation in which the context menu item did not work as advertised
- Firefox/Chrome parity: The Firefox version now uses native (i.e. normal and not wonky) tooltips
- Chrome fix: There was strangeness and not-working-ness when the panel was closed before it was done scanning and then re-opened
<b>2.0 RC 1 "Shine" (Apr 8, 2011)</b>
- An icon is displayed next to an artist's name if you are watching that artist's deviations
- Added a context menu item for finding an artist in Deviant Love
- Rewrote the tips at the bottom and added two more
- Firefox/Chrome parity: In Firefox, closing the report and then re-opening it on the same page no longer requires a re-scan
- Officially compatible with Firefox 4 (it worked before; just wasn't marked as compatible)
- It's shinier! :D
<b>2.0 Alpha 1 "You Spin Me Right Round, Baby" (Jan 8, 2011)</b>
- First version for Mozilla Firefox
- Minimum required Chrome version increased to 7
- New UI in Chrome which (probably) gives you more space for the list and is only tab-modal (meaning you need to close Deviant Love to continue using the tab) instead of browser-modal (the Firefox UI isn't anything-modal; it's a sidebar)
- Added a simple find bar; it'll get better in a post-2.0 release
<b>1.0.4 "Deviously Deviant Love" (Dec 28, 2010)</b>
- Fixed a bug caused by the <a href="http://hq.deviantart.com/blog/36320305/">Profile Page galleries upgrade</a> (which of course affected Faves pages as well) that caused Deviant Love to misidentify Collections and the Browse view as the Favourites view (of course, the Favourites view was being correctly identified, which I guess has something to do with broken clocks)
- Corrected the heart's tooltip (it said Devious Love :B)
- Restored compatibility with Chrome 4, which had been removed in 1.0.3
<b>1.0.3 "Super Scanner Is Ready" (Jun 10, 2010)</b>
- Deviant Love can now scan the Browse view and Collections of a Faves page (previously, they were treated identically to the Favourites view)
- The time between you opening a Faves page and heart appearing may be shorter
- Added plugs for <a href="http://deviantheart.deviantart.com/">#deviantHEART</a> and <a href="http://dalinksystem.deviantart.com/">#dALinkSystem</a> :)
<b>1.0.2 (Apr 13, 2010)</b>
- Middle-clicking a link in Deviant Love now works just like middle-clicking a link in a Web page
- A bug was fixed that would cause odd things to happen if you opened the popup, closed it before it was done scanning, and then opened it again
<b>1.0.1 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Corrected the extension's link to its deviation page
<b>1.0 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Initial (short-lived) release
