<b>1.0 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Initial (short-lived) release
<b>1.0.1 (Apr 3, 2010)</b>: Corrected the extension's link to its deviation page
<b>1.0.2 (Apr 13, 2010)</b>
- Middle-clicking a link in Deviant Love now works just like middle-clicking a link in a Web page
- A bug was fixed that would cause odd things to happen if you opened the popup, closed it before it was done scanning, and then opened it again
<b>1.0.3 "Super Scanner Is Ready" (Jun 10, 2010)</b>
- Deviant Love can now scan the Browse view and Collections of a Faves page (previously, they were treated identically to the Favourites view)
- The time between you opening a Faves page and heart appearing may be shorter
- Added plugs for <a href="http://deviantheart.deviantart.com/">#deviantHEART</a> and <a href="http://dalinksystem.deviantart.com/">#dALinkSystem</a> :)
