= OH HAI =

This is where the geekery that goes into Deviant Love happens. If you do not wish to partake in the geekery, but rather seek to install Deviant Love or have it described to you, see [[http://fav.me/d2my13o|its page on deviantART]].

= To Engage In Chrome/Chromium Geekery =

No special tools are needed! The Chrome folder is the unpacked Deviant Love extension, ready for hacking or testing! To run the unpacked extension in Chrome/Chromium, go to [[http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html]] and skip ahead to the "Load the extension" step.

= To Engage In Firefox Geekery =

Well, umm, some of the Firefox things are kept in the Chrome folder, haha. In order to get a working Firefox extension, do the following:
* Copy Chrome/core/ to Firefox/content/ (creating Firefox/content/core/)
* Run FxL10n.py (use [[http://www.python.org/|Python]], version 3)

To test the Firefox extension, I recommend following [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Building_an_Extension#Test|these directions]].

Don't touch stuff in Firefox/locale/; instead, make your changes in Chrome/_locales/ and then run FxL10n.py again. Feel free to mess with Firefox/content/core/, but Git will ignore it, so make sure your changes get copied back. Consider using a tool such as [[http://rsync.samba.org/|rsync]] to keep the core folders synchronized, or use tools such as [[http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html|Link Shell Extension]] or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link|symbolic links]] to make Firefox/content/core/ simply access Chrome/core/.

= Grabbing the Code of Chrome/Chromium Preview Versions =

Starting with version 2.0 RC 2, the exact code of preview releases for Chrome/Chromium is not directly available in the repository. The ChromePreview.patch contains the differences between the exact code and the available code; you can either run {{{git apply ChromePreview.patch}}} to get the exact code, or you can just read the patch file and figure out the differences yourself.
